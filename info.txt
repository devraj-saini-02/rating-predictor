This project builds a deep learning model to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on its text. The final implementation allows you to input a list of review strings and returns:

✅ The percentage of positive reviews

🏷️ A list of predictions labeled as "Positive" or "Negative"

This is useful for analyzing audience sentiment, automating feedback analysis, or integrating into movie-related applications and dashboards.
